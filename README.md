## Daily Overview

During this phase of the program, it is important to maintain a routine and help students succeed by keeping them accountable and continuously learning/growing. Mentors should continue to take attendance and inform their instructor of any student attendance issues. Students should break for lunch at 12:30pm, and be expected to return at 1:30pm sharp. Students are expected to be in class during all class hours, and are not permitted to come in late/leave early.

* 9:00am - 10:00am Mentor-guided Whiteboarding/Interview Practice
> Whiteboard/Katas are assigned as pre-class content on the LMS, solutions for Mentors can be found there as well.
* 10:00am - 12:30pm Students Working on Projects
* 12:30pm - 4:45pm Students Working on Projects
> Note: From 2:00 - 4:00pm, one mentor from the project room will leave the classroom to conduct Mock Interviews
* 4:45pm - 5:00pm Standups

### Daily White Boarding Instructions
	
Every night, students will be assigned a code wars kata as homework. There will be a mandatory kata, and an optional challenge kata. Solutions are included in the LMS for mentors only. Mentors should use one of these problems, or a very close variation of them, for the white boarding problem in the morning next day. The goal is to emphasize communicating the problem solving process, and not whether the students can actually solve any random problem. Students should send their mentors a link to their codewars account that mentors can use to hold students accountable. 

Additionally, students will be given technical interview questions to research every night. At the start of the white boarding session, mentors should ask the students the technical interview questions they were asked to study. After students respond, mentors should take time to provide feedback and correct any misunderstandings for the class. 

During daily white boarding, mentors should make sure students perform the following steps: 

<details closed>
	<summary>White Boarding Steps</summary>
	
* First ask the technical interview questions from the night before, then immediately give feedback and correct any misunderstanding for the class. Then move on to whiteboarding, where students should perform the following steps:

 1. Clarify the Question
 	* Students should beginning by clarifying what they are supposed to solve, and checking which edge cases should be accounted for. 
 2. Function Signature
 	* After clarifying the question, students should write out the function signature of the algorithm. A function signature indicates any parameters taken in and their datatypes, and the datatype of the output of the function.
	Example: ```fn(str) => arr```
 3. Sample Data and Output
 	* Students should write out a few sample arguments that cover all needed cases, and what their sample output should be. 
 4. Pseudocode
	* **This is the most important part of a white boarding interview!** Students should be able to write down the entirety of their problem solving process in plain english, such that any random person could simply follow the instructions to solve the problem. 
 5. Solve
 	* After psuedocoding, you should have another student come up to the board and explicitly, literally follow the pseudocode that was written by the preceding student. This will make clear the difference between good/bad pseudocode. 
 6. Test with Sample Data
 	* After writing out the solution on the board, copy the same exact syntax into a repl.it to see if it works.

## Holiday Flex Dates

Some cohorts will have Holiday Flex dates occur during the project phase of the curriculum. These days are to be used by students to complete any Competency work or outstanding Job Prep work, and should not be added to Personal Project/Group Project time unless they have completed any outstanding work first.

There should continue to be Whiteboarding sessions during the morning for these days, and then the students should move to Competencies, Job Prep, catching up on outstanding work, and finally digging into additional resources if they have time to do so. Students who do not have Holiday Flex dates occurring during the project phase will be expected to complete competencies and job prep work on their own time or during projects. 

## Personal Projects

Students should be allotted ~2.5 weeks for their Personal Projects. The current rubric can be found in the LMS in Unit 8.1. 

**Mentors are expected to review the rubric in its entirety before kicking off Personal Projects.**

On kickoff day, mentors should review the rubric in its entirety with the class. If any questions arise about the rubric, mentors should reach out to their Instructor for clarification.

**Mentors should inform students that only those students who pass their Personal Project will be eligible to participate in a Group Project**

Remember that students must complete the following Personal Project Pre-requisites **before** beginning their Project Planning:

* Students may not have more than 3 afternoon projects incomplete
* Students need a working create, read, update, and delete endpoint on Skills Check II **or** III
* Students need functioning authentication on Skills Check III
* Students need functioning React Redux on Skills Check III
* Students need functioning Routing on Skills Check II **or** III

### Personal Project Presentations & Paired Learning (Demo Day)
	
On Personal Project Presentation day, mentors should arrive early and begin setting up the lobby for presentations. Mentors should reach out to the Campus Manager beforehand for assistance in setting up for presentations. 

Project Presentations should begin around 9:15-9:30.

* Personal Project Presentations
    * Students should be alloted 3 minutes to present their project.
    * Prizes may be given for the following categories (May vary between campuses)
        * Best Overall (Most Shippable)
        * Most Technical
        * Best Business Solution
        * Best Presentation
        * Best UI/UX
    * The prizes are at your discretion, if it's decided that no one had a good design, or none of the projects satisifed a business solution, you may opt to remove that category. It's important to let the student's know that you may withdraw a category if none of the projects satisfy that field.
    * The actual prize can vary between campuses. I would recommend reserving a champion shirt for just the winner of best overall (most shippable) and providing a water bottle or some other form of swag for the other winners. You may opt to do a runner up, but it is not required and should generally only be done in large classes.
    * Mentors from the cohorts not presenting should do the judging.

After presentations, mentors should pair students (groups of 2-3), and assign them a technology to learn. 
They have until about 3:30 - 4:00 to work together to learn a new technology and build/prepare a small presentation for the rest of the class on that subject. 

At the end of the day, make sure to give students the following link to a set of Interview Questions that they will be expected to be able to answer in the Technical Interview lesson.

Link to questions (questions can also be found in the LMS as Pre-Class Content in Unit 10.5 (Tech Interview Prep)): 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T9Y5ih7N4efeBk7tQJJo7vp5yq6otjljOlffuqsdfqs/edit?usp=sharing

After presentations, move on to paired learning. For a list of technologies for paired learning, see below: 

<details closed>
   <summary>Paired Learning Day</summary>

## Objectives

* Student can consume documentation.
* Student can stay on task and work with loosely set expectations.
* Student can work cooperatively.
* Student can effectively demonstrate learned content

* Put the students in pairs, explain the purpose below, answer any questions, and cut them loose.

* Purpose
    * The goal is to have teams of two (or three depending on cohort size) that will select a topic from the list below.
    * They have the full day (until 3:30 or 4:00 depending on cohort size) to learn enough about that topic that they can then teach an intro (10 - 15ish minutes)
    * This could be a walkthrough, a proof of concept app, etc.
    * The students are left to their groups to consume documentation and learn.
    * Mentors can guide, but not teach.

* This list is not comprehensive

* React Native
https://facebook.github.io/react-native/ (Use https://snack.expo.io/ to skip setup and get coding fast)
Don’t install this on your computer as it could cost you hours for first time setup.
React Native allows you to use many of the React concepts you’ve learned to build native-like applications that can run on iOS and Android.

* Electron
https://electronjs.org/
Compile JS desktop apps
Slack and VSCode were both build on electron.  Bring all the learning of javascript and the web to cross-platform desktop clients.

* NextJS
https://github.com/zeit/next.js/
React Server Side Rendering
Next is a framework to help build Universal applications.  With Next pages are rendered as static pages server side, sent to the client, and then updated with a full react app after the initial load.  This style of code is more involved, but creates a fast and smooth user experience that, when done properly, can deliver fast load times AND rich user interactions

* NuxtJS
https://nuxtjs.org/
Vue Server Side Rendering
Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Universal Vue.js Applications.
Its main scope is UI rendering while abstracting away the client/server distribution.
Nuxt.js presets all the configuration needed to make your development of a Vue.js Application Server Rendered more enjoyable. In addition, Nuxt also provides another deployment option called: nuxt generate. It will build a Static Generated Vue.js Application. As a framework, Nuxt.js comes with a lot of features to help you in your development between the client side and the server side such as Asynchronous Data, Middleware, Layouts, etc.

* Gatsby
http://GatsbyJS.org
Gatsby is a static site generate build on node and React.  This kind of tool is popular amongst news websites and other sites that need new content regularly from the database, but that content isn’t interactable.  It’s presented content only.

* Ramda
http://ramdajs.com/
Makes functional programming easier in JS.
RamdaJS is a utility library like lodash that doesn’t pull any punches.  It uses all the functional goodies making it read odd to JS devs.  A major benefit to this style is the ability to make many small re-usable pieces of functionality.  Think of it like toy problem legos.  Every step you add to a toy problem solution creates a new function that could then be split, copied, or modified further for optimum re-usability.

* Redis
https://redis.io/
Redis is a lightning fast key-value data store. It’s is an open source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

* TypeScript
https://www.typescriptlang.org/
TypeScript is a strongly/statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean JavaScript. TypeScript starts from the same syntax and semantics that millions of JavaScript developers know today. Use existing JavaScript code, incorporate popular JavaScript libraries, and call TypeScript code from JavaScript. TypeScript compiles to clean, simple JavaScript code which runs on any browser, in Node.js, or in any JavaScript engine that supports ECMAScript 3 (or newer).

* Flow
https://flow.org
A static type checker for JavaScript
Flow is a static type checker for your JavaScript code. It does a lot of work to make you more productive. Making you code faster, smarter, more confidently, and to a bigger scale.
Flow checks your code for errors through static type annotations. These types allow you to tell Flow how you want your code to work, and Flow will make sure it does work that way.

* D3JS
https://d3js.org/
D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.

* GreenSock
https://greensock.com/
Ultra high-performance, professional-grade animation for the modern web.
HTML5 javascript animation built for professionals, GreenSock is packed with features that make most other engines look like cheap toys. Animate colors, beziers, css properties, arrays, scrolls and lots more. Round values, smoothly reverse() on the fly, use relative values, automatically accommodate getter/setter functions, employ virtually any easing equation, and manage conflicting tweens like a pro. Define callbacks, tween in seconds or frames, build sequences effortlessly (even with overlapping tweens), repeat/yoyo and more.

### Class Party

Mentors should host the cohort's class party **the day after** personal project presentations. The party should occur after 5:00pm. Mentors should reach out to the Campus Manager at the beginning of the week to make sure food is ordered in time. This party is designed to celebrate completion of Personal Projects, and facilitate student connections for Group Projects. 

## Job Prep Lectures
	
After Personal Projects, the next couple days should be lectures by the Outcomes Success team. Mentors should reach out to the Outcomes Director at the beginning of the week to clarify the schedule for these lectures. They usually last 1.5 days. Outcomes will have assignments that students should work on. Mentors should grade personal projects during this time. Any leftover time after these lectures should be used by students to catch up on missing assignments/competencies to get ready for badging/group projects.

### Job Prep II & Technical Interview Preparation Day

The last day of job prep should be also be used for Technical Interview day. This day consists of having students answer the interview questions they were asked to study previously, with mentors providing feedback on their responses. Mentors can bring in an extra mentor/instructor to provide additional feedback for students. 

There are a couple of formats Mentors have used in the past for this day, and any can be used:

* Jeopardy Style: Mentors split students into teams and have the class play a game of technical interview question jeopardy.
* Hot Seat: Mentors call a random student up to the front of the class and ask them a random technical interview question, providing feedback after a response while the whole class pays attention. 
* Group Review Style: Similar to the React Group Review day, students are split into groups and assigned sections of technical interview questions in turn. The groups come up with their best answers for each question, and then feedback is given for each group's responses. 

## Group Projects

Students should be allotted ~2.5 weeks for their Group Projects. The current rubric can be found in the LMS just before Unit 11. Remember that students must have a passing Personal Project by Group Project kickoff to be eligible to participate in a Group Project.

On kickoff day, mentors should solicit ideas from the class. Students should then be able to vote on their preference. Using student preferences, mentors should sync up with the Assistant Instructor of the cohort to assign group members to projects. 

After that, mentors should announce groups to the class, and then review the group project rubric in its entirety with the class. If mentors have any questions about the rubric, they should reach out to their Instructor for clarification.

### Mock Interviews

At the start of Group Projects, Mentors should set up a first come, first served schedule for Mock Interviews that students can sign up for. Students should be able to sign up for a 2:00pm or 3:00pm Mock Interview for the rest of the group project days. Mentors should conduct interviews until all students who wanted an interview have received one. Mentors can ask other mentors for assistance in completing this process if they are available. 

More information on Mock Interviews can be found below.

<details closed>
	<summary>Mock Interview Information</summary>
	
Mock interviews should be broken up into 4 parts: HR questions, Technical questions, whiteboarding, and giving the student time to ask questions. After the mock interview, make sure you provide students feedback on what they did well, and what they could improve on. We've found it works ideally to have 2 mentors in the interview, with one taking the role of HR and the other being the Technical lead, but if that's not possible, one mentor will suffice.
	
### HR Questions

<details><summary>HR</summary>

Typically we have the HR mentor take the lead on the discussion and start by asking the student a few questions from this list, this should not take up a majority of the time so typically limit it to 3 questions. You should ask at least 1 easier question, and at least 1 harder question.

##### Easier
- Tell us a little bit about yourself.
- Tell me about your experience working with your peers and mentors at DevMountain.
- How did you hear about our company, and why did you apply for this company?
- If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?
- What do you looking for from our company?
- How are you hoping to grow during your time with our company?

##### Harder
- What do you think sets you apart from the other candidates applying for this job?
- Can you tell us about a time you had to solve a conflict under pressure?
- Can you tell us about a personal flaw or weakness you'd like to improve on?

</details>

### Technical Questions

This should take up a majority of the time with the interview. With these questions we typically based the questions off how well the student had been doing in the course. Give them a few questions they can answer and at least one they can't. This gives them at least a little bit of confidence and it is also good to see how they handle a situation where they don't know the answer. 

Alternatively, if mentors have not yet assessed a student's verbal competencies, they can replace most of the technical interview questions with the verbal competencies, which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cu94ROldFh-jMt0X-kGLNC7oESPngSVVQCngAZixbDg/edit?usp=sharing

</details>

#### White Board

After the technical questions, give the student a whiteboarding problem. The problem should be hard enough where they will have to think about it won't be able to just jump straight into code. The purpose of the white board problem is to see how they think, not if they can solve it.

Below are some sample problems. The list is not definitive, feel free to use another problem.

<details><summary>Sample White Board Problems</summary>

- Write an algorithm that can find prime numbers.
- Write an algorithm that writes the Fibonacci sequence.
- Write an algorithm that converts a cabob case string to a camel case.
</details>

#### Closing, and Student Questions

At the end of the whiteboarding, ask the students the following questions:

- Where do you see yourself in the next 2-3 years?
- What salary are they looking for?

Then, give the student time to ask questions about the company. After answering the questions, conclude the Mock Interview and give students feedback on their performance. 
</details>

### Group Project Presentation Day

On Group Project Presentation day, mentors should arrive early and begin setting up the lobby for presentations. Mentors should reach out to the Campus Manager beforehand for assistance in setting up for presentations. 

Project Presentations should begin around 9:15-9:30. After presenting, students are welcome to go home or remain in class to complete any outstanding assignments/competencies.
