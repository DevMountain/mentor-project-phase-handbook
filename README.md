# Project Phase Handbook

In this Readme mentors will find instructions on how to manage the project phase of their cohorts, where they will be working independently with students.

## Daily

During this phase of the program, it is important to maintain a routine and help students succeed by keeping them accountable and continuously learning/growing. Mentors should continue to take attendance and inform their instructor of any student attendance issues. Students should break for lunch at 12:30pm, and be expected to return at 1:30pm sharp. 

* 9:00am - 10:00am Mentor-guided Whiteboarding/Interview Practice
* 10:00am - 12:30pm Working on Projects
* 12:30pm - 4:45pm Working on Projects
* 4:45pm - 5:00pm Standups

## Holiday Flex Dates

Some cohorts will have Holiday Flex dates occur during the project phase of the curriculum. These days are to be used by students to complete any Competency work or outstanding Job Prep work, and should not be added to Personal Project/Group Project time unless they have completed any outstanding work first.

There should continue to be Whiteboarding sessions during the morning for these days, and then the students should move to Competencies, Job Prep, catching up on outstanding work, and finally digging into additional resources if they have time to do so. Students who do not have Holiday Flex dates occur during the project phase will be expected to complete competencies and job prep work on their own time or during projects. 

## Personal Projects

Students should be allotted ~2.5 weeks for their Personal Projects. The current rubric can be found in the LMS in Unit 8.1. 

**Mentors are expected to review the rubric in its entirety before kicking off Personal Projects.**

If any questions arise about the rubric, mentors should reach out to their Instructor for clarification.

Remember that students must complete the following Personal Project Pre-requisites **before** beginning their Project Planning:

* Students may not have more than 3 afternoon projects incomplete
* Students need a working create, read, update, and delete endpoint on Skills Check II **or** III
* Students need functioning authentication on Skills Check III
* Students need functioning React Redux on Skills Check III
* Students need functioning Routing on Skills Check II **or** III

### Personal Project Presentations & Paired Learning (Demo Day)
	
On Personal Project Presentation day, mentors should arrive early and begin setting up the lobby for presentations. Mentors should reach out to the Campus Manager beforehand for assistance in setting up for presentations. 

For a list of technologies for paired learning, and detailed instructions on Project Presentations, see: https://github.com/DevMountain/web-curriculum/blob/master/unit-10/10.3-demo-day/Lesson.md

Project Presentations should begin around 9:15-9:30.

Afterward presentations, mentors should pair students, and assign them their paired learning technology to learn. 
They have until about 3:30 - 4:00 to work together to learn a new technology and build/prepare a small presentation for the rest of the class on that subject. 

At the end of the day, make sure to give students the following link to a set of Interview Questions that they will be expected to be able to answer in their next lesson.

## Job Prep Lectures
	
After Personal Projects, the next couple days should be lectures by the Outcomes Success team. Students should prepare and old resumes and job materials as well as any questions about the job hunt. Mentors should start grading personal projects during this time. Any leftover time after these lectures should be used by students to catch up on missing projects/competencies to get ready for badging/group projects.

### Job Prep II  Technical Interview Preparation Day

The last day of job prep is reserved . You can split the cohort into even teams and rotate through interview questions asking them to answer in the form of an actual interview. You can bring in an extra mentor/instructor for answer feedback to prepare and educate students on real interview situations and best practices in answering both questions the know how to answer and don't.
