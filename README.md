# Mentor Project Phase Handbook

In this Readme mentors will find instructions on how to manage the project phase of their cohorts, where they will be working independently with students.

## Daily

During this phase of the program, it is important to maintain a routine and help students succeed by keeping them accountable and continuously learning/growing. Mentors should continue to take attendance and inform their instructor of any student attendance issues. Students should break for lunch at 12:30pm, and be expected to return at 1:30pm sharp. Students are expected to be in class during all class hours, and are not permitted to come in late/leave early.

* 9:00am - 10:00am Mentor-guided Whiteboarding/Interview Practice
> Whiteboard/Katas are assigned as pre-class content on the LMS, solutions for Mentors can be found there as well.
* 10:00am - 12:30pm Working on Projects
* 12:30pm - 4:45pm Working on Projects
* 4:45pm - 5:00pm Standups

## Holiday Flex Dates

Some cohorts will have Holiday Flex dates occur during the project phase of the curriculum. These days are to be used by students to complete any Competency work or outstanding Job Prep work, and should not be added to Personal Project/Group Project time unless they have completed any outstanding work first.

There should continue to be Whiteboarding sessions during the morning for these days, and then the students should move to Competencies, Job Prep, catching up on outstanding work, and finally digging into additional resources if they have time to do so. Students who do not have Holiday Flex dates occur during the project phase will be expected to complete competencies and job prep work on their own time or during projects. 

## Personal Projects

Students should be allotted ~2.5 weeks for their Personal Projects. The current rubric can be found in the LMS in Unit 8.1. 

**Mentors are expected to review the rubric in its entirety before kicking off Personal Projects.**

On kickoff day, mentors should review the rubric in its entirety with the class. If any questions arise about the rubric, mentors should reach out to their Instructor for clarification.

**Mentors should inform students that only those students who pass their Personal Project will be eligible to participate in a Group Project**

Remember that students must complete the following Personal Project Pre-requisites **before** beginning their Project Planning:

* Students may not have more than 3 afternoon projects incomplete
* Students need a working create, read, update, and delete endpoint on Skills Check II **or** III
* Students need functioning authentication on Skills Check III
* Students need functioning React Redux on Skills Check III
* Students need functioning Routing on Skills Check II **or** III

### Personal Project Presentations & Paired Learning (Demo Day)
	
On Personal Project Presentation day, mentors should arrive early and begin setting up the lobby for presentations. Mentors should reach out to the Campus Manager beforehand for assistance in setting up for presentations. 

For a list of technologies for paired learning, and detailed instructions on Project Presentations, see: https://github.com/DevMountain/web-curriculum/blob/master/unit-10/10.3-demo-day/Lesson.md

Project Presentations should begin around 9:15-9:30.

After presentations, mentors should pair students (groups of 2-3), and assign them a technology to learn. 
They have until about 3:30 - 4:00 to work together to learn a new technology and build/prepare a small presentation for the rest of the class on that subject. 

At the end of the day, make sure to give students the following link to a set of Interview Questions that they will be expected to be able to answer in the Technical Interview lesson.

Link to questions (questions can also be found in the LMS as Pre-Class Content in Unit 10.5 (Tech Interview Prep)):

### Class Party

Mentors should host the cohort's class party **the day after** personal project presentations. Mentors should reach out to the Campus Manager at the beginning of the week to make sure food is ordered in time. This party is designed to celebrate completion of Personal Projects, and facilitate student connections for Group Projects. 

## Job Prep Lectures
	
After Personal Projects, the next couple days should be lectures by the Outcomes Success team. Mentors should reach out to the Outcomes Director at the beginning of the week to clarify the schedule for these lectures. They usually last 1.5 days. Outcomes will have assignments that students should work on. Mentors should grade personal projects during this time. Any leftover time after these lectures should be used by students to catch up on missing assignments/competencies to get ready for badging/group projects.

### Job Prep II & Technical Interview Preparation Day

The last day of job prep should be also be used for Technical Interview day. This day consists of having students answer the interview questions they were asked to study previously, with mentors providing feedback on their responses. Mentors can bring in an extra mentor/instructor to provide additional feedback for students. 

There are a couple of formats Mentors have used in the past for this day, and any can be used:

* Jeopardy Style: Mentors split students into teams and have the class play a game of technical interview question jeopardy.
* Hot Seat: Mentors call a random student up to the front of the class and ask them a random technical interview question, providing feedback after a response while the whole class pays attention. 
* Group Review Style: Similar to the React Group Review day, students are split into groups and assigned sections of technical interview questions in turn. The groups come up with their best answers for each question, and then feedback is given for each group's responses. 

## Group Projects

Students should be allotted ~2.5 weeks for their Group Projects. The current rubric can be found in the LMS just before Unit 11. Remember that students must have a passing Personal Project by Group Project kickoff to be eligible to participate in a Group Project.

On kickoff day, mentors should solicit ideas from the class. Students should then be able to vote on their preference. Using student preferences, mentors should sync up with the Assistant Instructor of the cohort to assign group members to projects. 

After that, mentors should announce groups to the class, and then review the group project rubric in its entirety with the class. If mentors have any questions about the rubric, they should reach out to their Instructor for clarification.

### Mock Interviews

During Group Projects, mentors should be pulling students out for Mock Interviews. Every student should complete a Mock Interview. Mentors can ask other mentors for assistance in completing this process. 

More information on Mock Interviews can be found below.

<details closed>
	<summary>Mock Interview Information</summary>
	
Mock interviews should be broken up into 4 parts: HR questions, Technical questions, whiteboarding, and giving the student time to ask questions. After the mock interview, make sure you provide students feedback on what they did well, and what they could do improve on. We've found it works best to have 2 mentors in the interview, with one taking the role of HR and the other being the Technical lead.
	
### HR Questions

<details><summary>HR</summary>

Typically we have the HR mentor take the lead on the discussion and start by asking the student a few questions from this list, this should not take up a majority of the time so typically limit it to 3 questions. You should ask at least 1 easier question, and at least 1 harder question.

##### Easier
- Tell us a little bit about yourself.
- Tell me about your experience working with your peers and mentors at DevMountain.
- How did you hear about our company, and why did you apply for this company?
- If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?
- What do you looking for from our company?
- How are you hoping to grow during your time with our company?

##### Harder
- What do you think sets you apart from the other candidates applying for this job?
- Can you tell us about a time you had to solve a conflict under pressure?
- Can you tell us about a personal flaw or weakness you'd like to improve on?

</details>

### Technical Questions

This should take up a majority of the time with the interview. With these questions we typically based the questions off how well the student had been doing in the course. Give them a few questions they can answer and at least one they can't. This gives them at least a little bit of confidence and it is also good to see how they handle a situation where they don't know the answer. 

Alternatively, if mentors have not yet assessed a student's verbal competencies, they can replace most of the technical interview questions with the verbal competencies, which can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cu94ROldFh-jMt0X-kGLNC7oESPngSVVQCngAZixbDg/edit?usp=sharing

#### White Board

After the technical questions, give the student a whiteboarding problem. The problem should be hard enough where they will have to think about it won't be able to just jump straight into code. The purpose of the white board problem is to see how they think, not if they can solve it.

Below are some sample problems. The list is not definitive, feel free to use another problem.

<details><summary>Sample White Board Problems</summary>

- Write an algorithm that can find prime numbers.
- Write an algorithm that writes the Fibonacci sequence.
- Write an algorithm that converts a cabob case string to a camel case.
</details>

#### Closing, and Student Questions

At the end of the whiteboarding, ask the students the following questions:

- Where do you see yourself in the next 2-3 years?
- What salary are they looking for?

Then, give the student time to ask questions about the company. After answering the questions, conclude the Mock Interview and give students feedback on their performance.
